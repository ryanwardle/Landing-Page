# Product Landing Page
This landing page is for a fictitious company called Van Delay Coffee.

## Goals for Product Landing page
1. Create a fully responsive product landing page.
2. Build entire landing page using only flexbox.

### Problems I ran into and notes

Did not design mobile first and this is going to cause the process of making
responsive to take longer. Next project I build needs to be designed mobile first.
